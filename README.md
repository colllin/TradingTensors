# TradingTensors

A simple trading simulator inspired by the OpenAI framework. The objective of the project is to explore the viability of AI (Supervised/ Reinforcement) algorithms in the financial markets. Models built in Tensorflow. Designed to carry out historical backtesting and live trading with Oanda API.
